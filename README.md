Welcome to LandSandBoat, an open source server emulator for FFXI.

## Getting Started

A [quick start guide](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide), the [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions), and a table of "[what works](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/wiki/What-Works)" are all available on [our wiki](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/wiki).

## Interacting with LandSandBoat

### Crashes, warnings, errors, bugs, gameplay issues, visual issues, etc.

Please create a new issue in the [issues tab](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/issues) after searching to see if your issue is already logged.

### Balance discussion, technical discussion, meta discussions, etc.

Discussions are similar to forum posts. Please open a new discussion post in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/discussions) for less directed and more open-ended conversation than issues.

*If you are encountering an issue, please open an issue and not a discussion!* It's much easier for us to track and you're more likely to get resolution through an issue.
